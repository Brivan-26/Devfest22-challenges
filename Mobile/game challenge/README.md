For most developers, Flutter is an app framework. But there’s also a growing community around casual game development, taking advantage of the hardware-accelerated graphics support provided by Flutter.Over the past year, thousands of Flutter games have been published. Flame, a community-driven open-source game engine built on top of Flutter, has been steadily growing both its contributors and users.
### Description

The game’s objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.
