## Introduction

Hey **Challenger** ü§ù ...

Apparently you have a great appetite for our challenges. or maybe you are a **10x engineer** üòéüíª?.

Let us introduce our selfs, we are **WTM Algiers LLC** a digital firm based in Algiers, Bay Area.

Founded in 2001 we are one of the world's leading innovators and manufacturers of creative video editing technology.

## Problem Statement

If you have been following up with the tech news lately you might have heard that **Adobe** has acquired the design tool that we all love [**Figma**](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2022/Adobe-to-Acquire-Figma/default.aspx).

And as you know with each acquisition, there is a chance for a new tool to emerge and gain a share of the market.

We have been thinking of creating a new fully open source design tool, that could be the future alternative to **Figma**.

But we need your help with building an early prototype as a proof of concept, with only the basic functionality. This will help us better sell our idea to our investors & collaborators.

### Features

We want for our prototype to be an MVP, and to include the following features:

- Supports drawing basic shapes (rectangles, ellipses, lines)
- Supports writing text.
- Supports changing elements colors.

### Bonus Features

- Supports dragging and moving objects in the draw area.
- Supports basic embeds (images).
- Supports custom text properties (size, font, color).

### Wireframe
